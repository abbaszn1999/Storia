✅ In Short
Storia Video Creator is a scalable, modular SaaS for AI-powered video and story creation.
 It supports multiple content modes and integrates advanced AI models for scriptwriting, imagery, video, and voice generation. The MVP focuses on Narrative Video Mode, laying the foundation for the broader multi-mode creator ecosystem coming next.



This is only an overview for our project
You should always think smartly in organizing the code base based on our project requirements, workflow and end goal 


Deep analyze the zip file which is the frontend and workflow for our tool and stick to the file uploaded for the frontend for the ui/ux user flow, side bar and all details. 

For now build the frontend, database structure, the codebase structure with a detailed awareness that from now till finalizing the project we should always organize our code for not refactoring later on and so on.


Note that we are not building a real functionality backend now, we are preparing the infrastructure only so consider that

Also i have uploaded my brand identity and my logo, and our business name is Storia.
