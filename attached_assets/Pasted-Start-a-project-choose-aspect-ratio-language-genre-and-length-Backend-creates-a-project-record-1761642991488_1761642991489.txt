Start a project
choose aspect ratio, language, genre, and length.
Backend creates a project record and saves your settings.


Write or import the script
If you paste text, it’s stored.
If you ask for help, an AI model writes a short script from your settings.
The final script text and a short summary are saved as version 1.


Break the script into scenes and shots
The system scans the script to find locations, characters, and actions.
It proposes scenes (e.g., “Scene 1: Playground”) and a small list of shots for each scene (wide, close-up, POV, etc.) with rough durations.
These scene/shot items are saved so the UI can show editable cards.


Pick the look and voices (World & Cast)
You choose an art style (e.g., “3D Cartoon”) and a voice model.
For each character, the system creates a simple “style card” (appearance notes).
The world style and character info are stored and reused for every shot.


Generate visuals for each shot (Storyboard)
For each shot card, the backend builds a clear prompt for image gen using:
	world style + scene details + camera type + character style.
It sends that prompt to an image generator and gets back a keyframe.

Also for each shot, we build a clear prompt for animating the image and turn it to a video using: world style + scene details + camera type + character style + the image keyframe


Build an animatic timeline
As shots come in, the backend keeps a simple timeline: which clip plays when, for how long.
This becomes the preview you can play.


Add audio (Edit)
Voiceover: The script (or selected lines) go to a TTS service → returns audio with timestamps.
Music: A matching track is chosen; volume auto-ducks under voice.
SFX: Common sounds (footsteps, door, wind) are attached to shots that need them.
The timeline is updated with these audio tracks.


Preview and adjust
You press play: the server streams the timeline using the saved image/video/audio files.
If you change a shot or duration, only that part regenerates; the timeline updates.


Final render (Preview → Generate)
The backend stitches everything into one MP4:
puts clips in order, applies the chosen aspect ratio,
mixes voice + music + SFX to a consistent loudness,
adds subtitles if requested.
The finished file is uploaded; you get a download link.
(Optional) Auto shorts
The system finds the most engaging moments and exports vertical clips.
