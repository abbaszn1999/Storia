# Quickstart

A complete walkthrough to schedule your first social media post with Late

This guide walks you through everything you need to schedule your first post. By the end, you'll have:
- Created a profile to organize your accounts
- Connected a social media account
- Scheduled a post to publish

**Prerequisites:** Make sure you have your [API key](/auth) ready.

## Step 1: Create a Profile

Profiles group your social accounts together. For example, you might have a "Personal Brand" profile with your Twitter and LinkedIn, and a "Company" profile with your business accounts.

```bash
curl -X POST https://getlate.dev/api/v1/profiles \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "name": "My First Profile",
    "description": "Testing the Late API"
  }'
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "_id": "prof_abc123",
  "name": "My First Profile",
  "description": "Testing the Late API",
  "createdAt": "2024-01-15T10:00:00.000Z"
}
```

Save the `_id` value — you'll need it for the next steps.

## Step 2: Connect a Social Account

Now connect a social media account to your profile. This uses OAuth, so it will redirect to the platform for authorization.

```bash
curl "https://getlate.dev/api/v1/connect/twitter?profileId=prof_abc123" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY"
```

This returns a URL. Open it in a browser to authorize Late to access your Twitter account. After authorization, you'll be redirected back and the account will be connected.

### Available Platforms

Replace `twitter` with any of these:
- `twitter` — Twitter/X
- `instagram` — Instagram (requires Facebook Business)
- `facebook` — Facebook Pages
- `linkedin` — LinkedIn (personal or company)
- `tiktok` — TikTok
- `youtube` — YouTube
- `pinterest` — Pinterest
- `reddit` — Reddit
- `bluesky` — Bluesky
- `threads` — Threads
- `google_business` — Google Business

## Step 3: Get Your Connected Accounts

After connecting, list your accounts to get the account ID:

```bash
curl "https://getlate.dev/api/v1/accounts" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY"
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "accounts": [
    {
      "_id": "acc_xyz789",
      "platform": "twitter",
      "username": "yourhandle",
      "profileId": "prof_abc123"
    }
  ]
}
```

Save the account `_id` — you need it to create posts.

## Step 4: Schedule Your First Post

Now you can schedule a post! Here's how to schedule a tweet for tomorrow at noon:

```bash
curl -X POST https://getlate.dev/api/v1/posts \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "content": "Hello world! This is my first post from the Late API 🚀",
    "scheduledFor": "2024-01-16T12:00:00",
    "timezone": "America/New_York",
    "platforms": [
      {
        "platform": "twitter",
        "accountId": "acc_xyz789"
      }
    ]
  }'
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "_id": "post_123abc",
  "content": "Hello world! This is my first post from the Late API 🚀",
  "status": "scheduled",
  "scheduledFor": "2024-01-16T17:00:00.000Z",
  "platforms": [
    {
      "platform": "twitter",
      "accountId": "acc_xyz789",
      "status": "pending"
    }
  ]
}
```

Your post is now scheduled and will publish automatically at the specified time.

## Posting to Multiple Platforms

You can post to multiple platforms at once. Just add more entries to the `platforms` array:

```bash
curl -X POST https://getlate.dev/api/v1/posts \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "content": "Cross-posting to all my accounts!",
    "scheduledFor": "2024-01-16T12:00:00",
    "timezone": "America/New_York",
    "platforms": [
      {"platform": "twitter", "accountId": "acc_twitter123"},
      {"platform": "linkedin", "accountId": "acc_linkedin456"},
      {"platform": "bluesky", "accountId": "acc_bluesky789"}
    ]
  }'
```

## Publishing Immediately

To publish right now instead of scheduling, omit `scheduledFor` and set `status` to `published`:

```bash
curl -X POST https://getlate.dev/api/v1/posts \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "content": "This posts immediately!",
    "status": "published",
    "platforms": [
      {"platform": "twitter", "accountId": "acc_xyz789"}
    ]
  }'
```

## Creating a Draft

To save a post without publishing or scheduling:

```bash
curl -X POST https://getlate.dev/api/v1/posts \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "content": "I will finish this later...",
    "status": "draft",
    "platforms": [
      {"platform": "twitter", "accountId": "acc_xyz789"}
    ]
  }'
```
